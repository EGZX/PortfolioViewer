# Code Quality & Standards

1.  **Senior Developer Quality**: Produce enterprise-grade, robust, and scalable solutions. Avoid quick hacks or temporary fixes.
2.  **Type Safety**: Use static type hinting (e.g., Type Hints in Python, TypeScript) for all public interfaces and complex logic to ensure code clarity and safety.
3.  **Modularity**: Follow SOLID principles. Keep functions and classes small, focused, and loosely coupled.
4.  **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling. Never silently swallow exceptions; handle them gracefully or propagate them with context.
5.  **Clean Code**: Prioritize readability. Use meaningful variable names that obviate the need for excessive commenting on "what" code does.
6.  **Performance**: Be mindful of complexity (Big O). Avoid premature optimization, but do not write obviously inefficient code.
