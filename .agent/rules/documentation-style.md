# Documentation Standards

1.  **Living Documentation**: Documentation reflects the *current* state of the project. It is not a Changelog.
2.  **Technical Precision**: Be concise and accurate. Avoid fluff.
3.  **Audience Aware**: Clearly state the purpose of the document and its intended audience (e.g., User vs. Developer) at the top.
4.  **No Fragmentation**: Do not create separate "fix" documents. Update the central documentation (e.g., README.md, Architecture docs) instead.
